# üß†‚öõÔ∏è `mlff-tutorial`

Tutorials on building Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) and running Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations for complex molecular systems using **PyTorch**, **OpenMM**, **ASE**, and **mond**.

This project serves as a hands-on guide for developing and applying ML-based potentials in atomistic simulations, bridging the gap between modern deep learning and computational chemistry.

## üöÄ What You'll Learn

* Constructing ML-based force fields using PyTorch & PyTorch Geometric
* Setting up atomistic datasets with ASE and mond
* Running GPU-accelerated MD simulations in OpenMM with custom force fields
* Evaluating and visualizing simulation results
* Handling real molecular data and integrating DFT reference calculations
